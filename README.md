# MyBundle.tv iFrame Integration Guide

This guide explains how to integrate MyBundle.tv iframes into your Next.js application. There are three main components available:
- Find My Bundle
- Marketplace
- Confirmation Page

Each component has both a testing (staging) and production version.

## Prerequisites

- Next.js 13+ application
- TypeScript support
- `next/script` component

## Installation

1. First, ensure your Next.js application is set up with TypeScript support.

2. Create a new page component in your Next.js application (e.g., `src/app/page.tsx`).

3. Add the 'use client' directive at the top of your page component since we'll be using client-side features.
